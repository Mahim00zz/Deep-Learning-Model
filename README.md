# Deep-Learning-Model

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model from scratch using only Numpy, to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks. The project will focus on the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the principles behind neural networks by building one from the ground up and provides a structured approach to evaluate its performance on a classic machine learning dataset..
